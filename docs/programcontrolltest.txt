The purpose of testing the ProgramController class is to check if it correctly combines the usage of the
command line along with the file handler. I used Mockito to mock the file handler so that the program
controller could be tested, which makes sure that the tests are based on logic and not just the files.

The first method i tested was the run method which uses logic based on the user's input and it has to test
that it does the correct thing. When 0 arguments are provided the controller should get the list of files
from the file handler and return them in a number format. The test makes sure that the returned string has
the correct format.

When a number argument is provided, the controller should convert the input into an index and select that
file at that index and call readFile() on it.

If a non-numeric argument is provided, the controller should return a number format exception and
provide a message saying error.

If a number argument outside of range is called the controller should return a out of range exception and
provide an error saying that.
