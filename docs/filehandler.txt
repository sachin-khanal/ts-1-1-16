documentation for handling direct access to files.


The file handler should get the files in the data folder for the command line to access and list the files.
they can be stored in a list and a method should return the list.
There should be error handling so the code doesnt crash if a file is not found/empty or a path is wrong.
use try-catch blocks to catch any errors that might come from getting the files.

Another method should read each line from a file and add it to a string.
use try-catch blocks to catch any errors while accessing the file.
use a loop to loop through each line and add it to a string.
